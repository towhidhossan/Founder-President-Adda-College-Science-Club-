Initiation and Leadership of Adda College Science Club

During my time at Adda College, I recognized the need for a dedicated platform where students with a passion for science, technology, and innovation could come together to collaborate, learn, and challenge themselves. To address this, I took the initiative to establish the Adda College Science Club, starting with an enthusiastic group of 20 founding members. My vision was to create a nurturing environment that would foster creativity, encourage scientific inquiry, and provide opportunities for students to showcase their talents.

Driving Team Success in a State-Level Coding Hackathon

As the leader of this newly formed club, I guided our members through various activities and projects designed to sharpen their skills. One of our most significant achievements came when we participated in a state-level coding hackathon, a prestigious event that drew over 100 highly competitive teams from across the region. Through strategic planning, effective teamwork, and relentless determination, I led our team to victory, securing the first-place prize of 20,000 taka. This accomplishment not only validated the hard work and dedication of our team but also established the Adda College Science Club as a formidable force in the academic community.
